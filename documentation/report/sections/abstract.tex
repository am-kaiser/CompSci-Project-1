\section*{Abstract} \label{sec:abstract}

Two dimensional polynomials of various orders are fit to noisy Franke function using linear regression methods. The regression methods are Ordinary least squares (OLS) and Shrinkage methods like Ridge and LASSO regression. The parameters are either found through analytical methods, scikit functions or found by optimising a cost function using stochastic gradient descent. Next, logistic regression and support vector machines are used to learn a classification model to predict whether a tumour is benign or malignant based on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Various statistics are utilised to determine the performance of the regression and classification models.
