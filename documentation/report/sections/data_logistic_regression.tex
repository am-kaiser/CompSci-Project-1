\subsection{Data} \label{subsec:data_logistic_regression}
For logistic regression and Support Vector Machines, we use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset \footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data}}. This dataset contains measurements for breast cancer cases. There are two types of cancer in the dataset benign and malignant. An overview of the dataset if given in the jupyter notebook \href{https://github.com/am-kaiser/CompSci-Project-1/blob/main/regression_analysis/examples/logistic_regression_analysis.ipynb}{logistic\_regression\_analysis} which can be found in the GitHub repository corresponding to this report. Based on this dataset we want to find a model which predicts the diagnosis, i.e. either benign or malignant. For the design matrix, we drop the column id and diagnosis from the data. The id is not important for making predictions and the diagnosis is what we want to predict.
